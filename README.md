**My primary stack is Java and Spring Boot for back end development**

I generally like to spread the love among different coding languages and frameworks, having mostly foused on Java/Spring Boot due to its worldwide use among companies for their back end systems, also like Swift for iOS development and I am a wanna be C/C++, feel interested in the complex systems that can be built on C but I am not very good at it yet.

I live in Mexico City

Two of my favorite activities is reading and watching youtube videos about philosophy

I use to play online videogames, one of the games I particularly love is AOE II

I consider myself a very optimistic person about the future, and excited to build software stuff that can be helpful for people, also love music and like to produce in my free time.
